CONCEPT NOTE

INTRODUCTION TO CERVICAL CANCER
Cervical cancer is a squamous cell carcinoma which is caused by persistent high risk human papillomavirus(HPV) infection which is a DNA virus of which there are about 40 strains that affect the anogenital region. They are classified as low-risk and high-risk types depending on their ability to cause cancer. The low risk types which include type 6 and 11 cause benign warts. The high risk types, type 16, 18, 31, 33, and 45 cause cervical cancer. HPV is spread during sexual intercourse which makes factors like early initiation of sexual intercourse, having multiple sexual partners and having a sexual partner with multiple sexual partners risk factors for acquiring HPV infection. Co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia increases the risk of cervical cancer as well as multiparity. Women whose immunity is compromised by infections like HIV are at risk of premalignant and malignant lesions of the cervix. Smoking reduces the efficiency with which the virus is cleared from the body. 

Cervical cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women, with an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide. It affects an estimated 22 million women, over the age of 15 worldwide, accounting for 25.8 to 32% of all female cancers. (Sung H, et al., 2020). Challenges in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer in Kenya include lack of knowledge of cervical cancer screening, distance to a health facility, poor health seeking behaviour, shortage of skilled healthcare personnel, poor HPV vaccination uptake, financial difficulties and inadequate health insurance coverage (Ba et al., 2021).

RISK PREDICTION IN CERVICAL CANCER
In Kenya, traditional methods of cervical cancer risk prediction primarily rely on opportunistic screening and clinical risk factors rather than predictive algorithms or structured models. The most widely used screening method is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), which is favored for its low cost and ease of use in low-resource settings, despite its subjectivity and lower specificity compared to cytology-based methods (Ngugi et al., 2012). Pap smears and HPV DNA testing are available but remain limited to urban centers due to cost, infrastructure, and laboratory constraints (Were et al., 2021). Risk assessment often depends on observable clinical symptoms and patient-reported risk factors such as early onset of sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, high parity, HIV status, and lack of screening history (Gichangi et al., 2003). HIV-positive women, in particular, are at significantly higher risk, and this has led to the integration of cervical cancer screening into HIV care in many health facilities (Mugisha et al., 2021). However, these traditional methods lack predictive precision and fail to leverage longitudinal data or population-level risk modeling, underscoring the need for more advanced tools, including AI-based approaches, to enhance early detection and targeted screening.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTHCARE 
Integrating AI into healthcare holds excellent potential for improving disease diagnosis, treatment selection, and clinical laboratory testing. AI tools can leverage large datasets and identify patterns to surpass human performance in several healthcare aspects. AI offers increased accuracy, reduced costs, and time savings while minimizing human errors. It can revolutionize personalized medicine, optimize medication dosages, enhance population health management, establish guidelines, provide virtual health assistants, support mental health care, improve patient education, and influence patient-physician trust. AI can be used to diagnose diseases, develop personalized treatment plans, and assist clinicians with decision-making. Rather than simply automating tasks, AI is about developing technologies that can enhance patient care across healthcare settings. However, challenges related to data privacy, bias, and the need for human expertise must be addressed for the responsible and effective implementation of AI in healthcare (Alowais et al., 2023).

AI FOR CANCER DETECTION AND RISK PREDICTION 
AI can automatically recognize images, extract features, learn classification, and process data using complex algorithms. The application of AI in the early screening and diagnosis of cervical cancer is conducive to addressing limited human resources and improving diagnostic accuracy. After the establishment of a good automated cytological detection model based on the AI method, some studies have found that cytological examination assisted by AI can classify cervical cells to guide triage and improved the detection rate of CIN compared with that of standard pathological biopsy results. (Hou et al., 2022). A prospective cohort study of 700,000 women in a population-based cervical cancer screening program using a validated AI-assisted cytological diagnostic system was conducted by Bao et al. They reported a total coincidence rate of 94.7% and a 5.8% increase in sensitivity (3.0–8.6%) compared to manual reading (Bao et al., 2020).

AI works well in both computing and image analysis which can improve the specificity and accuracy of screening and diagnostic programs, overcome time constraints and limited professional and technical personnel which will enable cervical cancer screening to be implemented in resource limited areas, reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. However, the use of AI carries some challenges. For machine learning, algorithms sometimes lack data in that they typically require millions of observations to achieve acceptable performance levels. Current clinical data may be scarce, lack markers, and have uncertain quality. Establishing multiple, standardized and large databases is also a concern. Models established using AI have not been applied and popularized in clinical practice; therefore, clinical studies are needed to verify these results. AI may also face system failures, requiring technical maintenance skills, therefore, maintenance systems need to be trained and established. AI is promising in cervical cancer screening, especially its application in cervical cytology. AI can be applied in the treatment, prognosis prediction, and prevention of cervical cancer. Further development of AI technologies will greatly enhance the prediction of cervical cancer, maximize the improvements in cervical cancer screening and diagnosis, optimize staging systems, and improve patient prognosis (Hou et al., 2022).

AI AND CERVICAL CANCER IN KENYA 
Holmström et al., 2021, did a study in 2021 where they developed and implemented a novel POC digital diagnostic system at a rural clinic in Kenya. Thirty Papanicolaou smears were collected at the clinic and digitized with a portable slide scanner, and whole-slide images were uploaded to a cloud platform using the local mobile data network for development and validation of a deep learning system (DLS). They measured the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of common forms of cervical squamous cell atypia with the DLS and validated the results by comparing them with the visual assessment of samples by independent pathologists. Results suggested that the detection of squamous cell atypia with the technology was feasible, with high sensitivity for slides demonstrating atypia, particularly for slides showing high-grade atypia. The clinical utilization of this technology could reduce the sample analysis workload for microscopists and provide a platform for general-purpose digital pathology, which is implementable in rural areas. As such, the technology could create new opportunities to facilitate the diagnostics of a variety of diseases that are still underdiagnosed, especially in low-resource settings.

GAPS IN APPLICATION OF AI IN CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING
Despite the growing global interest in artificial intelligence for medical diagnostics, there remains a significant gap in research focused on the application of AI in cervical cancer screening in Kenya. Most existing AI models have been developed and validated in high-income countries, limiting their applicability to low-resource settings due to differences in infrastructure, population characteristics, and disease burden (Xie et al., 2021). In Kenya, there is scarcity of  locally conducted studies or clinical trials assessing the diagnostic accuracy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or digital cytology tools. Furthermore, the literature lacks insights into ethical, legal, and social implications, particularly around data privacy, informed consent, and algorithmic bias in underserved populations (Manya et al., 2022). Infrastructure constraints, such as limited internet connectivity, inadequate digital imaging tools, and a shortage of trained personnel, further hinder implementation but are underexplored in current research (WHO, 2020). Additionally, there is minimal engagement of Kenyan healthcare providers, policymakers, and patients in the co-design or evaluation of AI tools, highlighting the need for context-specific participatory research and policy frameworks (Were et al., 2023). Addressing these gaps is crucial for ensuring that AI technologies are effectively and ethically integrated into cervical cancer prevention strategies in Kenya.

PROPOSED SOLUTION: MAMA-SCAN AI-POWERED MOBILE CERVICAL CANCER RISK PREDICTION TOOL
To bridge the gap between high cervical cancer incidence and limited screening capabilities in Kenya’s resource-constrained settings, we propose MAMA-SCAN, a mobile-based, AI-powered cervical cancer risk prediction tool designed for use by Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and Clinicians.This tool directly addresses the infrastructural, workforce, and diagnostic precision challenges by empowering frontline healthcare workers with a smart, offline-first decision support system for risk stratification and referral.
MAMA-SCAN leverages localized artificial intelligence models trained on clinical and demographic data from Kenyan populations to provide immediate, evidence-based cervical cancer risk assessments. It integrates both symptom-independent predictors (such as age, parity, HIV status, HPV vaccine status, sexual history, family history, and contraceptive use) and diagnostic results from cytology (e.g., Bethesda system categories), ensuring a multifactorial and personalized risk evaluation.
Key Features of MAMA-SCAN
1. Offline Functionality
Designed for rural and peri-urban areas with limited internet connectivity. CHVs and Clinicians can collect and input patient data offline. Data auto-syncs with centralized dashboards and health facility databases once internet access is restored, enabling seamless integration with Kenya’s health information systems.
2. AI-Powered Risk Scoring
Utilizes a machine learning model trained on local datasets to classify individuals into Low, Moderate, or High risk categories. Incorporates both structured input data and Bethesda cytology results (where available). Produces personalized, actionable screening and referral recommendations in real time.
3.Bethesda Cytology Integration
In facilities equipped with microscopy, a mobile-connected slide scanner captures Pap smear images. AI algorithms analyze cytological features to assign a Bethesda category (e.g., ASCUS, LSIL, HSIL). This result is automatically integrated with other clinical inputs (e.g., HIV status, HPV result, parity) to fine-tune the risk stratification output.
Suggested clinical actions are displayed on the app, such as:
“Repeat Pap in 1 year” (Low Risk)
“Refer to colposcopy” (Moderate Risk.
“Urgent specialist evaluation” (High Risk)
4. Integrated Referral and Monitoring System
Generates referral notifications directly within the app for high-risk patients. Tracks CHV  and Clinicians follow-up activity, number of patients screened, and outcomes flagged for review by supervising health professionals. Facilitates communication between CHVs,Clinicians and referral facilities, strengthening the screening-to-treatment continuation.
Potential impact 
1.	Enables early identification of high-risk women, even in the absence of lab-based HPV testing.
2.	Increases screening coverage by leveraging the trusted role of CHVs.
3.	Improves referral efficiency and patient triage, reducing unnecessary clinic visits and focusing resources where needed.
4.	Builds real-time, anonymized health data for monitoring trends and training algorithms, strengthening Kenya’s health surveillance systems. 
Next steps
1.	Data Acquisition & Model Development: Partner with regional hospitals and research institutions to access anonymized cytology reports, clinical data, and historical patient records for training and validation of the AI model.
2.	Prototype Development: Build a lightweight Android app with user-friendly interfaces tailored to CHVs' digital literacy levels.
3.	Pilot Testing: Deploy MAMA-SCAN in selected counties with high cervical cancer burden and low screening uptake.
4.	Validation & Evaluation: Conduct implementation research to assess feasibility, usability, diagnostic accuracy (compared to physician diagnoses), and impact on referral rates.
5.	Scale-Up: Collaborate with the Ministry of Health,NGOs and county governments for nationwide integration and sustainable deployment.

SUMMARY
Cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) strains such as types 16 and 18 and is a significant public health concern in Kenya. Risk factors include early sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, co-infections such as HIV, smoking, and high parity. Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with over 600,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths annually. In Kenya, barriers such as limited awareness, poor healthcare access, and low HPV vaccination uptake hinder effective prevention and early detection. Traditional cervical cancer risk prediction in Kenya relies on opportunistic screening methods like Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA), and to a lesser extent, Pap smears and HPV DNA testing. These approaches are constrained by cost, infrastructure, and workforce shortages. These methods largely depend on observable clinical symptoms and known risk factors rather than predictive modeling, highlighting the need for improved, data-driven approaches.

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions in healthcare, including enhanced diagnostic accuracy, cost-efficiency, and personalized treatment planning. Specifically, AI's ability to analyze medical images and process large datasets could transform cervical cancer screening by compensating for human resource limitations and improving diagnostic precision. In Kenya, a pioneering study by Holmström et al. (2021) demonstrated the feasibility of using AI-assisted digital diagnostics in rural clinics, showing high sensitivity in detecting cervical cell atypia. Despite this promise, significant gaps remain in the application of AI in cervical cancer screening in Kenya. Most AI models have not been adapted to the local context, and there is limited research on their clinical performance, ethical implications, and infrastructural requirements in low-resource environments. Additionally, engagement with local stakeholders and the development of supportive policy frameworks remain minimal. 

MAMA-SCAN, a mobile, AI-powered cervical cancer risk prediction tool, is made to be used by community health volunteers (CHVs) and clinicians in Kenya. It works offline, analyzes local clinical and demographic data, and integrates Bethesda cytology results to assess risk levels as low, moderate or high. The tool provides real-time, personalized screening recommendations and enables automated referrals and follow-up tracking. MAMA-SCAN aims to improve early detection, expand screening access, and optimize resource use in low-resource settings.  Addressing these gaps is essential for ensuring that AI technologies can be effectively and equitably integrated into Kenya’s cervical cancer prevention efforts.
